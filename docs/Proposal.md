# 1. Housing Price Prediction
### Author : Manasvi Pentareddy

### 2. Background
The Boston Housing dataset comprises various socio-economic attributes associated with housing in Boston. These attributes include factors such as crime rates, air quality, and access to highways, among others. The dataset is commonly used in predictive modeling tasks, particularly for estimating median house prices. By analyzing the relationships between these features and housing prices, machine learning algorithms can be trained to make accurate predictions, aiding in real estate valuation and urban planning efforts.

* RAD : index of accessibility to radial highways.
* TAX : full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
* PTRATIO : pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* B : 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

* MEDV : Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.
